# ML_Basics
A collection of small projects to build a strong foundation in Machine Learning concepts.

Starting with building Decision Trees, Random Forests from scartch.
Then I want to attempt to build a basic neural network from scratch.

Following this I want to do some projects to explore the implementations of scki-kit learn, TensorFlow (with and without keras) and PyTorch.

ANyone who might also be intersted in the code may feel free to look through my various scripts.

Disclaimer: A lot of this code will be based on online tutorials and use standard datasets which are publicly availbale. I do not claim ownership of any of these. This is just an educational venture for me.
